Flask app - user input through forms built in HTML, URLs mapped to functions.

Components are:

- Queue to receive notification in the form of webhooks
- Servicer to take events from top of queue and handle them appropriately - each trigger will have a specific workflow
- API client to interface with external systems
- Querier to use API client(s) to fetch data from one or more sources, filter and correlate
- Worker to manipulate the data if necessary and use API client(s) to push data into one or more destinations and trigger events in other systems
- Reporter to communicate results of actions using API client(s) to external systems

Forms:

- Configuration of Components
    - Servicer - event definition (eg webhook content and source) + workflow function
    - Querier - external system(s) + data identifiers (eg filter, columns) + qualifier (eg full, partial, comparison, most recent, specific date)
    - Worker - output system(s)
    - Reporter - comms platform(s) + template msg
