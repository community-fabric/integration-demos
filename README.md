# integration-demos
This repo is used for the Python examples used to demonstrate IP Fabric's integrations with other systems.  For example:
* [netbox-demo](netbox-demo) 

    This directory contains Python Flask app and some CSS and static content to provide a webhook handler to synchronise data with Netbox as shown in the demo in [this video](https://youtu.be/EdP3v8fq_jo)
